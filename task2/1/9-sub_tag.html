    <h1>LINEAR EQUATIONS</h1>
    <P>an equation that has maximum one is known 
    as linear equation. the graph of it is a streight line
    <br> for example:</P>
    <ul>
        <li>y=8x-2</li>
        <li>ax<sub>1</sub>+bx<sub>2</sub>-cx<sub>3</sub>=9</li>
    </ul>

    <p>are some of the example of linear equation in two and three variable</p>
    
    <p>slope of  intersection of two linear equation linear linear equations
    <br>y<sub>1</sub>=mx<sub>1</sub>+a and 
    <br>y<sub>2</sub>=mx<sub>2</sub>+b
    <br>for the points p(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and q(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) is:
    <br>m=(y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>)/(x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)
    </p>
