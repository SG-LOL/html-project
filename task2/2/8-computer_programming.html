    <p><mark> Coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs,</mark>
         that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and 
         implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by
          writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically
           use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible 
           to human than machine code, which is directly executed by the central 
           processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in 
           several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
            details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized 
            algorithms, and formal logic. Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to
             programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging
              (investigating and fixing problems), <u>implementation of build systems,
               and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code.</u> <br><br>
               While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software
                development is used for this larger overall process - with the terms
                 programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and
                  editing of code per se. <mark>Sometimes software development is known as
                   software engineering,</mark> especially when it employs formal methods or
                    follows an engineering design process.</p>

                        The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician
                         Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of
                          Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
                           Analytical Engine. However, Charles Babbage had already written
                            his first program for the Analytical Engine in 1837. <br><br>
                            In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing
                             data in machine-readable form.Later a control panel (plug board)
                              added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed
                               for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment
                                such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control
                                 panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers.
                                  However, with the concept of the stored-program computer
                                   introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored
                                    and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.</p>

                                    <p>Programming is, quite literally, all around us. 
                                        From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream,
                                         code enables everyday actions in our lives.
                                          Tech companies are no longer recognizable as
                                           just software companies instead, they bring food to our door,
                                            help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential elections,
                                             or act as a personal trainer.</p>
