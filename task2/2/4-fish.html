    <p>A fish (pl.: fish or fishes) is an aquatic, anamniotic, 
        gill-bearing vertebrate animal with swimming fins and a 
        hard skull, but lacking limbs with digits. Fish can be 
        grouped into the more basal jawless fish and the more common
        jawed fish, the latter including all living cartilaginous and 
        bony fish, as well as the extinct placoderms and acanthodians.
        Most fish are cold-blooded, their body temperature varying with 
        the surrounding water, though some large active swimmers like white 
        shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Many fish can 
        communicate acoustically with each other, such as during courtship 
        displays. </p>
